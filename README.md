# Parking Threat
Fitting your car in the parking spot was never easy. Improve your parking skills with **Parking Threat**! 


## What is Parking Threat?
Parking Threat is a web based game which consists in parking a car in a parking place. There are two rows of parked cars and one free parking spot. The color of the cars and orientation, the parking place position and the pedestrian clothes are random, so that each time you play you get a whole new gaming experience! 

## Why should you play it?

The main goal of this game is to provide you the spacial skills you need to become a parking master. Tired of expensive car body reparations? This is your game!

## How can you play it?

Move your car with the arrow keys. Be careful with pedestrians and other cars. If you hit either of them, **game over**. If you get to park your car without crashing it, congrats! you **win**.

## What can still be done?
This game could be even better! Some ideas for further work:
+ Fix the pedestrians obstacle: once the first pedestrian walks out the canvas, no second pedestrian comes :-(
+ Count collisions: the player looses after n collisions.
+ Play again button: just calls game.init() again.
